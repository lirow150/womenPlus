            <p id = "firstP">  After completing my Bachelorâ€™s in computer science, I will be well prepared with various skills and knowledge.  It will help me get a quality job. 
                Following graduation, I am confident of getting a position as a software programmer in a High-tech Company. 
                Also, I see myself as a successful software engineer and learning new skills that will benefit a High-tech company.   Besides getting a good job, 
                I want to create a non-profit organization that will help other students learn something with dedication as I am learning.  So many students like me do not have enough money to get higher education.
                So many students hold part-time jobs and study hard to do their best in college.  I want to become a scholarship donor in the future for the Hispanic community and women cursing science classes like me.   </p>

            <p id = "secondP"> One day after my birthday, I got into my car and drove to Niagara Falls.  I visited the Canada site, which was the most amazing experience ever.  I was exhausted by driving, but it was all worth it. </p>
            <p> if you want to travel there I would recomend you to take a tour of the falls.  The majestic waterfalls of Niagara need to be seen to be believed. Also, take a helicopter ride and enjoy a cruise on the Maid of the Mist.
